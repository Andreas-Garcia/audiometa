# Git Progressive Push Script
# 
# This script addresses GitHub's file size limitations by pushing changes progressively
# instead of attempting to push all files at once. This is particularly important for
# audio files which can be large and may exceed GitHub's push size limits.
#
# The script works by:
# 1. Getting a randomized list of modified files
# 2. Processing files one by one
# 3. Committing and pushing each file individually
# 4. Repeating until all files are processed
#
# This approach prevents "remote: error: File is too large" errors when pushing
# large audio files or many files simultaneously to GitHub.

# Check if the commit message is passed as an argument
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "ERROR: please provide a commit message as an argument." >&2
    exit 1
