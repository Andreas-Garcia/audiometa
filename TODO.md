# TODO

This file tracks future work, improvements, and testing tasks for AudioMeta Python.

## Rating Profile Compatibility Testing

### High Priority

- [ ] **Test rating profile compatibility across different audio players**
  - Verify which rating values are actually readable and display correctly
  - Test Profile A (255 non-proportional) with Windows Media Player, MusicBee, Winamp, kid3
  - Test Profile B (100 proportional) with FLAC players and Vorbis-compatible software
  - Test Profile C (255 proportional) with Traktor Pro and Traktor DJ

## Feature Enhancements

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Implement synchronized lyrics support in future versions**

  - Add support for SYLT (Synchronized Lyrics/Text) frames in ID3v2
  - Implement time-stamped lyrics for karaoke and synchronized text display
  - Support multiple synchronized lyrics entries with different languages

- [ ] **Implement full multi-language unsynchronized lyrics support in future versions**

  - Extend USLT (Unsynchronized Lyrics) frame support for multiple languages
  - Add language code handling (ISO 639-2) for lyrics and other text fields
  - Support multiple lyrics entries in different languages within the same file

- [ ] **OGG file support**

  - Currently planned but not implemented
  - Vorbis comment support for OGG files
  - Integration with existing Vorbis manager

- [ ] **Batch processing with parallelization**

  - Add Python API functions for processing multiple audio files (CLI already supports this)
  - Bridge the gap between CLI multi-file support and single-file Python API
  - Implement parallel metadata reading/writing operations for better performance
  - Add progress tracking and consolidated error handling for batch operations
  - Consider thread pool or multiprocessing for CPU-intensive tasks
  - Provide both sequential and parallel processing options

- [ ] **Remove audio file class and move capabilities directly into metadata manager**

- [ ] **Check multi-value separators compatibility with standard metadata readers**

  - Current implementation uses prioritized separators: "//", "\\\\", "\\", ";", "/", "," for joining multi-value fields
  - Smart parsing logic applies when null separators (\x00) are present (always parse) or for single entries without nulls (legacy data detection)
  - Test compatibility with standard readers like iTunes, VLC, Windows Media Player to ensure correct parsing of multi-value metadata

- [ ] **Check compliance with each format's max length limitations with adapted exceptions and tests**

  - Verify ID3v1 (fixed sizes: e.g., title 30 bytes, artist 30 bytes), ID3v2 (variable but practical limits), RIFF, and Vorbis format constraints
  - Implement or adapt exceptions for length violations
  - Add unit and integration tests to validate length enforcement and error handling

- [ ] **Provide a Docker image**

  - Create a Dockerfile for the project
  - Set up containerized environment for easy deployment and testing
  - Include necessary dependencies and entry points

- [ ] **Broadcast Wave Format (BWF) support**

  - Implement reading and writing of BWF metadata for WAV files
  - Extend RIFF manager or create dedicated BWF manager
  - Add support for BWF-specific fields like time reference, originator, etc.
